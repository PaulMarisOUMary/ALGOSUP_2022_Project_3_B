## 2.Project Scope

| ![Shape2](RackMultipart20220110-4-1clwo1n_html_b9b23772e3a921a1.gif) | Our Goals are the following: Create sound from our code, being able to apply filters to the aforementioned sound such as reverb, low pass, or echo, and being able to store and read music to the disk as both MP3 and WAV format. However, we don&#39;t need to do: A graphical interface and recording sound using the microphone |
