# Project 3: Sound Synthesizer Group B

Technical Specification **January 2022**  
Team: Maxime PAGES, Pierre GORIN, Paul MARRIS, Laurent BOUQUIN, Florent HUREAUX, Arthur LEMOINE

# Overview

## 1.Project Description

 The aim of this project is to create a sound synthesizer that can be used to create programmable music. We were tasked to reach this goal using the F# language, while only using the SFML library if possible.

## 2.Project Scope

 Our Goals are the following: Create sound from our code, being able to apply filters to the aforementioned sound such as reverb, low pass, or echo, and being able to store and read music to the disk as both MP3 and WAV format. However, we don't need to do: A graphical interface and recording sound using the microphone.

## 3.High-Level Requirements

Our Software must able to deliver the following:

- Ability to create sound using code
- Ability to apply filters on sound
- Ability to play sound from the code
- Ability to save Sound to the Disk
- Ability to read Sound from the Disk

## 4.Deliverables

Our Deliverables are the following:

1. **Create and play basic notes**
    Delivery date : the 14<sup>th</sup> of January 2022
2. **Basic filters, envelopes and chord** 
Delivery date : for the 21<sup>th</sup> of January 2022
3. **Frequency analysis and advanced filters**
Delivery date : the 28<sup>th</sup> of January 20022
4. **MP3 compression** 
Delivery date : the 11<sup>th</sup> of February 2022



## 5.Affected Parties

 This project can affect the people who like programming and/or music and that want to progam musics or sounds themselves using the notes.

## 6.Affected Business Processes or Systems

Help people that need a library to make music in F#. It can be include in some other projects.

## 7.Specific Exclusions from Scope

This project will not provide any new functionalities, such as an graphical interface or play sound from microphone.
If the project is released before the 11<sup>th</sup> of February 2022, we will try to add new functionalities.
